Where do Citi Bikers ride? When do they ride? Which stations are most popular? What days of the week are most rides taken on? 
I invite you to follow along as I discover the answers to these questions and more. This data is provided according to the Citi Bike Data Use Policy.


After creating and analyzing our visualizations, there is a phenomenon I found that happened in March, where the sudden increase in riders from 19.24% to 61.92% (lower right chart). A quick google search for tempurature records in New York 2022 showed that there is distinctive change in tempurature from 41F(Feb) to 50F(Mar). 
Is tempurature change the main cause of the sudden increase of riders? Another theory is that gasoline price was increased dramatically form $3.65 to $4.29 per gallon in 2022, marking the first impact of our historic inflation this year.
